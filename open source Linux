linux:Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds: to create a new free operating system kernel. The resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments,[1] under the GNU General Public License v2.[2]: 7 [3][4]
After AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote it in a new programming language, C, to make it portable. The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.

In 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.[5][6]

Onyx Systems began selling early microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980. Later, Sun Microsystems, founded as a spin-off of a student project at Stanford University, also began selling Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun workstations didn't utilize commodity PC hardware like Linux was later developed for, it represented the first successful commercial attempt at distributing a primarily single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix operating system.[7][8]

In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[9] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]

In 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.[10]

In 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System.[11] This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.

In 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.[12]

TMySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/)[5] is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).[5][6] Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My,[7] and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.

MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).[8] In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.[9]

MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL, but more often, MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that need relational database capability. MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. MySQL is used by many database-driven web applications, including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress. MySQL is also used by many popular websites, including Facebook,[10][11] Flickr,[12] MediaWiki,[13] Twitter,[14] and YouTube.[15]hese factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or 386BSD kernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own.
Drupal (/ˈdruːpəl/)[5] is a free and open-source web content management system (CMS) written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License.[4][6][7] Drupal provides an open-source back-end framework for at least 14% of the top 10,000 websites worldwide[8] and 1.2% of the top 10 million websites[9]—ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites.[10] Systems also use Drupal for knowledge management and for business collaboration.[11]

As of March 2022, the Drupal community had more than 1.39 million members,[12][13][14] including 124,000 users actively contributing,[15] resulting in more than 48,300 free modules that extend and customize Drupal functionality,[16] over 3,000 free themes that change the look and feel of Drupal,[17] and at least 1,400 free distributions that allow users to quickly and easily set up a complex, use-specific Drupal in fewer steps.[18]

The standard release of Drupal, known as Drupal core, contains basic features common to content-management systems. These include user account registration and maintenance, menu management, RSS feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple website, a single- or multi-user blog, an Internet forum, or a community website providing for user-generated content.

Drupal also describes itself as a Web application framework.[19] When compared with notable frameworks, Drupal meets most of the generally accepted feature requirements for such web frameworks.[20][21]

Although Drupal offers a sophisticated API for developers, basic Web-site installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills.[22]

Drupal runs on any computing platform that supports both a web server capable of running PHP and a database to store content and configuration.
